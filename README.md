This repository contains wrapper Go code around [Unlynx](https://github.com/lca1/unlynx)
that can be transpiled into Javascript using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).
The resulting Javascript code is packaged as NPM module and used in [Glowing Bear](https://github.com/lca1/glowing-bear) as part of the [MedCo Project](https://lca1.github.io/medco-documentation).

Refer to the corresponding [MedCo Documentation](https://lca1.github.io/medco-documentation) page for more information and usage instructions.
